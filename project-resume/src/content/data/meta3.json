The timeline page will be the outlier, but we will get to that later. Using the concepts of atomic design, I can use React hooks to build out individual pieces of the application so that we can plug and play. Claudia, on my project's UI/UX team, taught me a lot about building the style guide atomically. Thinking of simple React Hooks as the atoms. A small combination of 1-2 atoms as a molecule. A combination of atoms and/or molecules, generally with some state management an organism. And everything you see between the header and the footer is a page. If you download React Developer tools on your browser, I will be referencing it as I go."
