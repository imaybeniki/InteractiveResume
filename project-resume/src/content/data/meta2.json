Deciding on an interactive resume as my desired project, the main topics I wanted to address were standard resume sections, and a couple of sections on the process. The section Meta, respresented by a puzzle piece, is a series of articles explaining the process behind creating this project (articles like this one). And finally Learn, represented by a brain: short articles about technical concepts for a non-technical audience."
